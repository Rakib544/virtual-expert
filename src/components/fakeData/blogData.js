    subTitle_3: "How is UPC scanned?",

So a product can be precisely identified at any place, i.e., within its departments, between the retailer and the manufacturer, inventory, shipping or point of sale.

    subTitle_4: "How to find a UPC barcode for Amazon?",
    description_5:
      "It is unnecessary to get a barcode for every product you sell, but it can be helpful for your product supply and movement. To get a UPC barcode, you will have to join the GS1 and get a unique GS1 Company Prefix.  This prefix, a unique set of digits, identifies your company as the authorized manufacturer of your product supply chain.  With this prefix, you can use up to 100 UPCs. You may not need a company prefix for internal usage, but it will be required when you sell your products in retail stores where official UPC barcodes are needed. <br /> Calculate the number of products for which you need a UPC barcode. If you are selling a shirt and it is available in 4 different colors, you will need four barcodes for the product. Each color will have a different barcode. Furthur if three sizes are available in each color, each size will have a different code. Meaning you will need 12 barcodes for all shirts of different colors and sizes. <br /> Secondly, the number of digits your company prefix will have is calculated from the total number of barcodes you require. Suppose you want 5327 ( 4 digits) barcodes, then your company prefix will have 11-4=7 digits, and the 12th digit is the check digit which is also mathematically calculated from the 11 digits.",

    description_6:
      "The cost of the UPC barcode depends upon the number of barcodes you require. Then there is an initial fee and annual renewal fee accordingly.<table class='table'><thead><tr><th scope='col'>Number of Products</th><th scope='col'>Initial Fee</th><th scope='col'>Annual Renewal Fee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 – 10</td><td>$250.00</td><td>$50.00</td></tr><tr><td>11 – 100</td><td>$750.00</td><td>$150.00</td></tr><tr><td>101 – 1,000</td><td>$2,500.00</td><td>$500.00</td></tr><tr><td>1,001 – 10,000</td><td>$6,500.00</td><td>$1,300.00</td></tr><tr><td>10,001 – 100,000</td><td>$10,500.00</td><td>$2,100.00</td></tr><tr><td>NDC/NHRIC Company Prefix</td><td>$2,100.00</td><td>$2,100.00</td></tr></tbody></table>  <br /> You can select the way you want to incorporate the barcode on your product. By receiving them in file format, you can add them to your packaging design with Adobe Photoshop. They are also available in the form of physical barcodes with your unique UPCs, and you can paste these labels on your products. <br /> There are some legitimate third-party UPC sellers as well. They buy barcodes in bulk from the GS1, and you can buy from them as well. In this way, you can buy cheap UPCs compared to the GS1, but they will have the third party's company name, and some big retailers, including Amazon, will not accept these barcodes. So if you are planning to buy UPCs for amazon, it is better to get them from GS 1. <br /> If you are willing to sell your products on Amazon, it is necessary to buy the UPCs from the GS1 because if your UPCs do not match the information on the GS1 database, Amazon will not accept your  UPCs. You may need barcodes for Amazon FBA. ASINs and GTINs are also terms you may come across while getting barcodes for Amazon. Let's have an introduction to these terms.",
